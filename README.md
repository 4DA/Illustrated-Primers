## [Indra's Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein](https://amzn.to/2ODIoed)
### David Mumford, Caroline Series, David Wright (2002)

Felix Klein, a great geometer of the nineteenth century, rediscovered an idea from Indian mythology in mathematics: the heaven of Indra in which the whole Universe was mirrored in each pearl in a net of pearls. Practically impossible to represent by hand, this idea barely existed outside the imagination, until the 1980s when the authors embarked on the first computer investigation of Klein's vision. The book explores the patterns created by iterating conformal maps of the complex plane called Möbius transformations, and their connections with symmetry and self-similarity. It includes step-by-step instructions for writing computer programs for beginners to generate the images.

## [Visual Complex Analysis](https://amzn.to/2M66DzY)
### Tristan Needham (1997)

![Cover of Visual Complex Analysis](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VluVCvfTL._SX339_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

A book on complex analysis that uses geometry instead of calculation as a means of explanation. It has lots of diagrams aimed at undergraduate students in mathematics, physics, and engineering. The book has intuitive explanations supported with hundreds of geometric diagrams. The book doesn't require advanced prerequisites and has a user-friendly prose style will help students to master the subject.

## [Visual Complex Functions: An Introduction with Phase Portraits](https://amzn.to/35t2VYQ)
### Elias Wegert (2012)

![Cover of Visual Complex Functions](http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/files/personal/10/vcf3.png)

This book provides a systematic introduction to functions of one complex variable. It uses [phase potraits](https://wikipedia.org/phase_portrait) to visualize functions as images on their domains. The book requires no prerequisites except some basic knowledge of real calculus and plane geometry. It is self-contained and covers all the main topics usually treated in a first course on complex analysis. With separate chapters on various construction principles, conformal mappings and Riemann surfaces it goes somewhat beyond a standard programme and leads the reader to more advanced themes.
